# gRPCFastFoodOrderService
The FastFood Order Service project is a fast food ordering service that uses gRPC to manage communication between clients and a server. The goal is that customers can place food orders remotely, and the server processes them and returns a response with a unique order identifier and order status.

## Client-Server Communication:
The project uses gRPC, a high-performance RPC framework, and communicates via HTTP/2.0 using Protocol Buffers (protobuf) for serialization.

## Service Definition:
The service is defined using .proto files, which specify the structure of the messages (requests and responses) and the RPC methods.

## Server Logic:
The server listens for order requests, generates a unique order ID, and responds with the order status. It implements the gRPC server defined by the Protocol Buffers.

## Client Logic:
The client sends an order request to the server by providing customer details and a list of food items. It then waits for the server's confirmation response.
